How to choose an AWS Certification 🤔

AWS currently offers 12 certifications: 1 foundational, 3 associate level, 2 professional level and 6 specialty certifications.

Which one is the best for you?

🤍 Foundational level is a good place to start if you have no knowledge of the cloud. Whether if you are technical and non-technical you will find prep courses easy to follow. You can take a free cloud essentials course on skillbuilder.aws and after completion you will be ready to get certified.
Average Prep time: less than 1 month. Cost $100.

💙 Associate levels. Great as a starting point for technical roles (Developer, SA, SysOps). If you don’t have any prior AWS knowledge, I suggest to start with the AWS Cloud Practitioner and then move an associate level.
Average Prep time: ~3 months. Cost $150
Tip: Every time you achieve an AWS certification you get 50% discount on the next one. Taking foundational + associate level will cost $100 + $75 so only extra $25 compare to just an associate level $150.

💚 Professional levels. If you have practical experience with AWS services you can go for a professional level (SA or DevOps). There was a requirement to have an associate level first, but it’s no longer the case. However I advise to get an associate level before studying for a professional certification.
Average Prep time: 3-6 months. Cost $300

💜 Specialty level is not as hard as a professional level. They are focused on a specific domain. If you don’t have prior knowledge in that domain then prep will take longer time. For example, AWS ML prep specialty doesn’t teach ML concepts but rather how to implement ML on AWS. Therefore you need to have prior domain/specialty expertise.
Average Prep time: 3 months. Cost $300
